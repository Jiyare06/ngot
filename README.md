Pros of Tailwind CSS:

Faster styling using utility classes directly in HTML.

Built-in responsiveness and hover/focus states.

No need to maintain a separate stylesheet.

Consistent spacing, typography, and colors.

Cons of Tailwind CSS:

Can clutter HTML with many classes.

Requires learning Tailwindâ€™s utility class naming.

Limited by what utilities provide (need plugin/custom for complex designs).

Original CSS Pros:

Clean HTML (separation of structure and style).

More semantic and readable for non-Tailwind users.

Easier for beginners to understand.

Original CSS Cons:

Slower to build and maintain.

Must manage layout, spacing, breakpoints manually.

Less DRY (repeat values/styles frequently).
